TCP and UDP protocols are used in transport layer.

TCP-connection oriented-connection should be established before data sent.
UDP-connectionless-requires no connection before data is sent. 

TCP and UDP both uses port numbers from 0-6535.
The combination of IP address and port number is used to create socket.

threeway handshake for tcp
host A------SYN----->HOST B
      <-----SYN ACK--
      ------ACK----->
UDP-USer datagram Protocol:

Connectionless
 Does not guarantee delivery
 Does not send acknowledgments
 but faster than TCP
 Does not provide sequencing
 Does not resend dropped segments
 Does not provide flow control
 performs CRC on data
 uses port numbers
