Virtual local area network:
A switch can logically segemented into sperate braodcast domains using the VLASN's.
  • Traffic between devices within the same VLAN is switched.
  • Traffic between devices in different VLANs requires a Layer-3
    device to communicate.
 Broadcasts from one VLAN will not be forwarded to another VLAN
 
 A VLAN-enabled switch supports two types of ports:
• Access ports
• Trunk ports

ACCESSPORT :An access port is a member of only a single VLAN. Access ports are most
often used to connect host devices, such as computers and printers.


 There are two methods of connecting a VLAN across multiple switches:
     • Create uplink access ports between the switches, one for each VLAN. 
     • Create a trunk connection between the switches.
     
A trunk port is not a member of a single VLAN. The traffic from any or all
VLANs can traverse trunk links to reach other switches. 

VLAN Frame-Tagging :
When VLANs span multiple switches, a mechanism is required to identify
which VLAN a frame belongs to. This is accomplished through frame
tagging, which places a VLAN ID in each frame.
Tagging only occurs when a frame is sent out a trunk port. Traffic sent out
access ports is never tagged. 

Native Vlan:
Native VLANs
Recall that a trunk port tags frames with a VLAN ID. But what happens if a
trunk port receives an untagged frame?
The native VLAN determines the VLAN that untagged traffic belongs to.
By default on all trunking ports, the native VLAN is VLAN 1. The native
VLAN can be changed on a per trunk port basis:
 Switch(config)# interface gi2/24
 Switch(config-if)# switchport mode trunk
 Switch(config-if)# switchport trunk native vlan 42
