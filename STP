spanning tree protocol:
=======================
1)Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) was developed to prevent the broadcast storms caused by switching loops.

2)Switches running STP will build a map or topology of the entire switching
  nettwork. STP will identify if there are any loops, and then disable or block
  as many ports as necessary to eliminate all loops in the topology. 
  
3)A blocked port can be reactivated if another port goes down. This allows
  STP to maintain redundancy and fault-tolerance

4)STP switches exchange Bridge Protocol Data Units (BPDU’s) to build the
  topology database. BPDU’s are forwarded out all ports every two seconds,
  to a dedicated MAC multicast address of 0180.c200.0000.

5)Building the STP topology is a multistep convergence process:
         • A Root Bridge is elected
         • Root ports are identified
         • Designated ports are identified
         • Ports are placed in a blocking state as required, to eliminate loops

ROOT BRIDGE:A Root Bridge is elected based on its Bridge ID, comprised of two
===========  components in the original 802.1D standard:
            • 16-bit Bridge priority
            • 48-bit MAC address
          The default priority is 32,768, and the lowest priority wins. If there is a tie
          in priority, the lowest MAC address is used as the tie-breaker.
  Note:By default, a switch will always believe it is the Root Bridge, until it
       receives a BPDU from a switch with a lower Bridge ID. This is referred to
       as a superior BPDU. The election process is continuous – if a new switch
       with the lowest Bridge ID is added to the topology, it will be elected as the
       Root Bridge		  

Identfying ROOT PORTS:
======================
              The root port is to find the Root Bridge.
              Each switch can only have one root port. The Root Bridge cannot have a root port.
              The root port of each switch has the lowest root path cost to get to the Root Bridge.			  
			  
Identifying Designated Ports:
============================= 
              a)A single designated port is identified for each network segment. This
              port is responsible for forwarding BPDUs and frames to that segment.
			  
			  b)every network segment must have one designated port,
              regardless if a root port already exists on that segment.
      
	     Note:    Note: A port can never be both a designated port and a root port. 
		 
		 
        Note:If two ports are eligible to become the designated port, then there is a loop.
             One of the ports will be placed in a blocking state to eliminate the loop.	  
			 
STP PORT STATES:
================
• Blocking
• Listening
• Learning
• Forwarding 

• A blocking port will not forward frames or learn MAC addresses.
• A blocking port will still listen for BPDUs from other switches, to
learn about changes to the switching topology. 


• A listening port will not forward frames or learn MAC addresses.
• A listening port will send and listen for BPDUs, to participate in the
election of the Root Bridge, root ports, and designated ports.
• If a listening port is not elected as a root or a designated Port, it will
transition back to a blocking state. 


• A learning port will continue to send and listen for BPDUs.
• A learning port will begin to add MAC addresses to the CAM table.
• However, a learning port cannot forward frames quite yet. 


• A forwarding port is fully functional – it will send and listen for
BPDUs, learn MAC addresses, and forward frames.
• Root and designated ports will eventually transition to a forwarding
state. 

disabled. A port in a disabled state
has been administratively shutdown. A disabled port does not forward
frames or participate in STP convergence. 
			 
			 
			 
			 
			 
			 
			 Two implementations of RSTP exist:
• Rapid Per-VLAN Spanning Tree Protocol (RPVST+)
• Multiple Spanning Tree (MST)
