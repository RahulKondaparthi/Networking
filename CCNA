Basic Network types:
--------------------
1)LAN: A LAN is generally a high-speed network that covers a small geographic area, usually contained within a single building or campus. A LAN is
       usually under the administrative control of a single organization. Ethernet is the most common LAN technology
2)WAN: WAN is a network that spans large geographical locations, usually to connect multiple LANs.WAN is a network that traverses a public or
       commercial carrier, using one of several WAN technologies

Open sytem Interconnection(OSI):
--------------------------------
7 Application    : provides the interface between the user application and the network. A web browser and an email client are examples of user applications.ftp,telnet
6 Presentation   : controls the formatting and syntax of user data for the application layer. This ensures that data from the sending application can be understood by the receiving application. 
5 Session        :is responsible for establishing, maintaining,and ultimately terminating sessions between devices. If a session is broken,this layer can attempt to recover the session
4 Transport (segments)
                 :is responsible for the reliable transfer of data, by ensuring that data arrives at its destination error-free and in order(TCP,UDP)
3 Network  (Packets)
                 :controls internetwork communication,logical addressing and routing, (IP)
2 Data-link (Frames)
                 :the Data-Link layer (Layer-2) is responsible for transporting data within a network.(MAC and Logical link control)
                  The Data-link layer packages the higher-layer data into frames, so that the
                  data can be put onto the physical wire. This packaging process is referred to as framing or encapsulation. (rthernet)
1 Physical (bits)
                  : transferring of raw bits onto the physical medium.
                  
Ethernet:
---------
Ethernet is a technology that provides data link and physical specifications for controlling access across shared network medium.
The Ethernet Frame:
An Ethernet frame contains the following fields:

Layer-2 Switching:
------------------
Layer-2 devices build hardware address tables, which at a minimum contain the following:
• Hardware addresses for hosts
• The port each hardware address is associated with
• Hardware address learning
• Intelligent forwarding of frames
• Loop avoidance 

Layer-2 devices will make intelligent forwarding decisions based on the frame (or data-link) headers. A frame can then be forwarded out only the appropriate destination port,
instead of all ports.
Ethernet switches build MAC address tables through a dynamic learning process.Switches always learn from the source MAC address in a frame.


Spanning tree Protocol:
-----------------------
A Layer-2 switch belongs to only one broadcast domain, and will forward both broadcasts and multicasts out every port but the originating port. 
When a switching loop is introduced into the network,broadcast storm will develop within seconds.

Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) was developed to prevent the broadcast storms caused by switching loops. 
Switches running STP will build a map or topology of the entire switching
  nettwork. STP will identify if there are any loops, and then disable or block
  as many ports as necessary to eliminate all loops in the topology. 
  
3)A blocked port can be reactivated if another port goes down. This allows
  STP to maintain redundancy and fault-tolerance

4)STP switches exchange Bridge Protocol Data Units (BPDU’s) to build the
  topology database. BPDU’s are forwarded out all ports every two seconds,
  to a dedicated MAC multicast address of 0180.c200.0000.

5)Building the STP topology is a multistep convergence process:
         • A Root Bridge is elected
         • Root ports are identified
         • Designated ports are identified
         • Ports are placed in a blocking state as required, to eliminate loops

ROOT BRIDGE:A Root Bridge is elected based on its Bridge ID, comprised of two
===========  components in the original 802.1D standard:
            • 16-bit Bridge priority
            • 48-bit MAC address
          The default priority is 32,768, and the lowest priority wins. If there is a tie
          in priority, the lowest MAC address is used as the tie-breaker.
  Note:By default, a switch will always believe it is the Root Bridge, until it
       receives a BPDU from a switch with a lower Bridge ID. This is referred to
       as a superior BPDU. The election process is continuous – if a new switch
       with the lowest Bridge ID is added to the topology, it will be elected as the
       Root Bridge		  

Identfying ROOT PORTS:
======================
              The root port is to find the Root Bridge.
              Each switch can only have one root port. The Root Bridge cannot have a root port.
              The root port of each switch has the lowest root path cost to get to the Root Bridge.			  
			  
Identifying Designated Ports:
============================= 
              a)A single designated port is identified for each network segment. This
              port is responsible for forwarding BPDUs and frames to that segment.
			  
			  b)every network segment must have one designated port,
              regardless if a root port already exists on that segment.
      
	     Note:    Note: A port can never be both a designated port and a root port. 
		 
		 
        Note:If two ports are eligible to become the designated port, then there is a loop.
             One of the ports will be placed in a blocking state to eliminate the loop.	  
			 
STP PORT STATES:
================
• Blocking
• Listening
• Learning
• Forwarding 

• A blocking port will not forward frames or learn MAC addresses.
• A blocking port will still listen for BPDUs from other switches, to
learn about changes to the switching topology. 


• A listening port will not forward frames or learn MAC addresses.
• A listening port will send and listen for BPDUs, to participate in the
election of the Root Bridge, root ports, and designated ports.
• If a listening port is not elected as a root or a designated Port, it will
transition back to a blocking state. 


• A learning port will continue to send and listen for BPDUs.
• A learning port will begin to add MAC addresses to the CAM table.
• However, a learning port cannot forward frames quite yet. 


• A forwarding port is fully functional – it will send and listen for
BPDUs, learn MAC addresses, and forward frames.
• Root and designated ports will eventually transition to a forwarding
state. 

disabled. A port in a disabled state
has been administratively shutdown. A disabled port does not forward
frames or participate in STP convergence.
