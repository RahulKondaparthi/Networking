Basic Network types:
--------------------
1)LAN: A LAN is generally a high-speed network that covers a small geographic area, usually contained within a single building or campus. A LAN is
       usually under the administrative control of a single organization. Ethernet is the most common LAN technology
2)WAN: WAN is a network that spans large geographical locations, usually to connect multiple LANs.WAN is a network that traverses a public or
       commercial carrier, using one of several WAN technologies

Open sytem Interconnection(OSI):
--------------------------------
7 Application    : provides the interface between the user application and the network. A web browser and an email client are examples of user applications.ftp,telnet
6 Presentation   : controls the formatting and syntax of user data for the application layer. This ensures that data from the sending application can be understood by the receiving application. 
5 Session        :is responsible for establishing, maintaining,and ultimately terminating sessions between devices. If a session is broken,this layer can attempt to recover the session
4 Transport (segments)
                 :is responsible for the reliable transfer of data, by ensuring that data arrives at its destination error-free and in order(TCP,UDP)
3 Network  (Packets)
                 :controls internetwork communication,logical addressing and routing, (IP)
2 Data-link (Frames)
                 :the Data-Link layer (Layer-2) is responsible for transporting data within a network.(MAC and Logical link control)
                  The Data-link layer packages the higher-layer data into frames, so that the
                  data can be put onto the physical wire. This packaging process is referred to as framing or encapsulation. (rthernet)
1 Physical (bits)
                  : transferring of raw bits onto the physical medium.
                  
Ethernet:
---------
Ethernet is a technology that provides data link and physical specifications for controlling access across shared network medium.
The Ethernet Frame:
An Ethernet frame contains the following fields:
Field                                                    Length                                                    Description
